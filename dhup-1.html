<h1>The Dynamic Host Update Protocol (DHUP) Version 1</h1>

<ol>
<h2><li>Introduction</li></h2>

<p>The Dynamic Host Update Protocol is a means for providing Internet
hosts with non-fixed addresses a simple method of updating their
current address with a dynamic DNS server.</p>

<h2><li>Protocol</li></h2>

<p>A DHUP client connects to a DHUP server, as discussed in
"Encapsulation", over an unreliable datagram protocol allowing
transmission of 8-bit bytes.</p>

<p>The client sends a single update datagram to the server and waits
for a response from the server.  If no response is received after (?)
seconds, the client resends will double the timeout duration and
repeat the above process.  The server will respond with a datagram
indicating if the update succeded, unless the server cannot build a
response from the incoming data, in which case the request is dropped
with no response.</p>

<p>The datagram is composed of a list of strings, seperated by a
single NUL (ASCII 0) byte.  There is no trailing NUL byte following
the last string.</p>

<p>The update datagram contains the following strings (in order):

<ol>
<li>Protocol signature</li>
<li>Sequence number</li>
<li>Domain name</li>
<li>New IP address</li>
<li>New MX name</li>
<li>Secondary MX flag</li>
<li>Pass phrase</li>
</ol>

The protocol signature must always be "<tt>DHUP-1</tt>".  The sequence
is a unique increasing integer identifying the query.  The domain name
identifies which domain to update, as well as which identity the
authentication data should be compared against.  The new IP address
and MX name are the new values to be stored in the server.  The IP
address must be expressed in standard dotted-decimal notation.  If the
MX name is blank, no MX records are stored on the server.  The
secondary MX flag is an integer that, if set to non-zero, indicates
that the new MX name is to be used as a secondary MX, with the primary
MX being the domain name.  The pass phrase is a copy of a secret ASCII
phrase shared between the client and server.</p>

<p>The sequence number is used to determine if the request is a new
one or has already been received by the server.  After authentication,
if the sequence number is less than the sequence number of the last
update accepted by the server, the update is rejected.  If the
sequence number is the same as the sequence number of the last update
accepted by the server, the update is accepted without being
processed.  Otherwise, the update is processed and the sequence number
is stored on the server.  A convenient value for the sequence number
is the local UNIX epoch time value.</p>

<p>The response datagram contains the following strings (in order):

<ol>
<li>Response signature</li>
<li>Sequence number</li>
<li>Response code</li>
<li>Textual message</li>
</ol>

The response signature must always be "<tt>DHUPR-1</tt>"
The sequence number is copied from the request datagram.
Response codes are listed below.
The textual message is informational in nature and is only to be used
to provide more detail to the user of the client.</p>

<h2><li>Response Codes</li></h2>

<p>Response codes are grouped into the following groups:

<ul>
<li>2xx Update was accepted
<li>4xx Client error
<li>5xx Server error
</ul>

The following specific response codes are defined:

<ul>
<li>201: No errors encountered, DNS data was updated.</li>
<li>202: DNS data was previously updated.</li>
<li>401: Data format error.</li>
<li>402: Authentication failed.</li>
<li>403: Old sequence number.</li>
<li>501: Database update failed.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2><li>Encapsulation</li></h2>

DHUP may be used on top of UDP. A DHUP-over-UDP server listens for
connections on port 941.

<h2><li>Security Considerations</li></h2>

<p>All authentication data is sent in the clear with this protocol.
It is therefore possible for an attacker to capture a single update
packet and use it to forge new updates.</p>

<p>A future version (2) of this protocol will use the digital
signature algorithm (DSA) to sign the contents of the datagram with
the client's private key, which can be verified against the client's
public key stored on the server.  Version 1 is intended primarily as a
proof-of-concept test platform.</p>

<p>The sequence number has been inserted for two reasons.  First,
since the underlying protocol is inherently unreliable, it must be
possible to process duplicate requests with a minimum of effort.
Second, with version 2 of this protocol, the sequence number will be
used to prevent replay attacks.</p>

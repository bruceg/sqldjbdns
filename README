SQL DNS server based on djbdns

Sqldjbdns is an authoritative DNS server that pulls its data directly
from a set of SQL tables.  It supports fully dynamic A, MX, TXT, and PTR
records, and run-time configurable static NS and SOA records.  It also
supports schedule expiry and introduction of records.

At the moment, only PostgreSQL is supported, but support for other SQL
standard databases and different table schemas should be fairly easy to
add.  The RPM does not install in a ready-to-run form.

To build the package, you need to unpack and build the djbdns-1.02
package inside the build directory of sqldjbdns by downloading the
djbdns-1.02.tar.gz package and running:
	gzip -dc djbdns-1.02.tar.gz | tar -xf -
	make -C djbdns-1.02
Then run "make" in the build directory of sqldjbdns.

sqldjbdns
SQL DNS server based on djbdns

2000-11-08

Sqldjbdns is a new authoritative DNS server that pulls its data directly
from a set of SQL tables.  It supports fully dynamic A, MX, and PTR
records, and static NS and SOA records.

This package is in a very preliminary state.  No configuration program
has been included, and the documentation is minimal.  At the moment,
only PostgreSQL is supported, but support for other SQL standard
databases and different table schemas would be fairly easy to add.

A mailing list has been set up to discuss this package.  To subscribe,
send an email to:

Development versions of sqldjbdns are available via anonymous CVS.
Set your CVSROOT to ":pserver:cvs@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org:/CVS",
login with an empty password, and check out the sqldjbdns module.
